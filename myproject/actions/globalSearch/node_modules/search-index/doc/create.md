# Creating search indexes

Search indexes are created by `require`-ing `search-index` and passing it startup options.

```javascript
var options = {} //put the startup options you want here
var searchIndex = require('search-index')
searchIndex(options, function(err, si) {
  //do stuff with si
});
```

## Startup options

### Defaults

The defaults options are equivalent to this:

```javascript
  {
    deletable: true,
    fieldedSearch: true,
    indexPath: 'si',
    logLevel: 'error',
    nGramLength: 1,
    stopwords: SearchIndex.getStopwords('en'),
    store: true
  }
```

### deletable

Non-deletable indexes are smaller, so if file size is a consideration
(for example: if the index is to be replicated), and deletion
unnecessary set `deletable` to false.

### fieldedSearch

It may be desirable to search on individual fields, but this takes up
lots of space in the index. Set `fieldedSearch` to false if fielded
search is not needed, and file size is a consideration.

### indexPath

Specifies the name of the keystore on the system.

### logLevel

Specifies a [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) log level

### nGramLength

If you want to search for phrases, then the nGramLength has to be
adjusted. The [array represents all](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index/blob/master/doc/add.md#ngramlength) lengths (in words) that the searchable phrases can contain.

### stopwords

Words that are not indexed. The default is english (en), but you can choose
any common and meaningless words for your language or domain.

### store

You may only want to store some of the fields in the
document. Speciify which fields to store in `fieldOptions`. The value
of `store` here becomes the default value for `fieldOptions`
